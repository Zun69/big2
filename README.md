Currently creating Big 2 using HTML, vanilla JavaScript, and CSS.

Using these two videos to get ideas: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMYCWccL-3U & https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxRwIZWjLtE&t=112s

Using this website as a guideline for rules: https://www.pagat.com/climbing/bigtwo.html, but I am implementing the rules that I normally play with, this game allows 10 J Q K A 2 (highest straight), A 2 3 4 5 (lowest straight), 2 3 4 5 6 (second lowest straight).
