Currently creating Big 2 using HTML, vanilla JavaScript, and CSS.

Using this website as a guideline for rules: https://www.pagat.com/climbing/bigtwo.html, but I am implementing the rules that I normally play with, this game allows 10 J Q K A 2 (highest straight), A 2 3 4 5 (lowest straight), 2 3 4 5 6 (second lowest straight). Same thing for straight flushes, ♠J ♠Q ♠K ♠A ♠2 would be the highest straight flush and ♦A ♦2 ♦3 ♦4 ♦5 would be lowest straight flush.
